If you have successfully installed [FlyThings IDE](download.md), then on your desktop, find the ![ZKSW-Editor shortcut](assets/ide/quick_link.png) shortcut and double-click to run it.  
If you delete the shortcut, you can also find ![ide](assets/ide/ide.png) in the `bin` folder in the installation directory and run it directly.
## Choose a workspace
When you run the tool, the following interface will pop up.
* **Workspace** is used to store related settings and historical records. You can understand it as a container, which can manage multiple projects at the same time, so there is no need to run multiple development tools at the same time.

If you open the software for the first time, or choose a new workspace, then you will see a welcome interface like the picture below.
It provides two shortcut functions: **New Project** and **Import Project**

    It will guide you step by step [How to create a new FlyThings project](new_flythings_project.html)
