## Add log
* Required header files
  ```c++
  #include "utils/Log.h"
  ```
    FlyThings' printing uniformly calls `LOGD` or `LOGE` macro output, and the usage method is the same as that of C language `printf`; there are examples (commented out by default, open when needed) of calling in the code generated by default:


    ```c++
    static bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {
        LOGD("onButtonClick_Button1\n");
        return true;
    }
    ```

## View print log

### View via command line (recommended)
1. Find the top menu of the software, and then open the menu `Debug configuration`->`Open system command line`
2. If you use a USB cable to connect to the device, directly enter `adb shell logcat -v time` in the command line and then enter the Enter key. If the computer is connected to the device normally, you will see all the log information of the device.  
  If you are using a network connection, such as WIFI, Ethernet, you have to check the device first, get the device's IP address, and then enter `adb connect 192.168.1.123` in the command line (change the IP address yourself), and then Enter the Enter key, if the IP is correct and the connection is normal, you will see this message: `connected to 192.168.1.123:5555`,  
  After the normal connection, enter `adb shell logcat -v time` and enter the Enter key to see all the log information.
3.  You can use the `Ctrl + C` key combination to stop the log display.


### View in UI interface (deprecated)
  After connecting [ADB](adb_debug.md) , you can view the print log of the program through our tool. The specific steps are as follows:

  1. On the menu bar, select `Debug Configuration` -> `Switch Log Window`, the tool will switch to another interface.

  2. åœ¨In the lower left corner of the new interface, select **LogCat**, if the connection is normal, in the red box area on the right, you will see the machine's print log.
