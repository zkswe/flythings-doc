   >[!TIP]
   > For new users, the SDK part is already included in the FlyThings IDE installation package, so there is no need to download it again. If you want to update the SDK part independently, you can manually download and unzip it, and replace the original SDK folder. [**SDK Update Package**](http://download.flythings.cn/ide/sdk.7z)(1.4.5)
