When your new project is completed, you will see the following interface 
 
  ![Interface after the new project is completed](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1dXL2aOfrK1RjSspb7634pFXao.png)  
  
The editor is roughly divided into six areas. The respective functions are as follows:  
  1. **① Area-Project Explorer** It displays the resource files and code files in the project folder in the form of a tree diagram. You can expand/collapse freely, double-click the file to directly open it for editing. The specific demonstration is as follows:

  2. **② Area-UI edit box**  Mainly responsible for the editing and instant preview of the UI interface, it is the main operation area in the development
  3. **③ Area-Control Panel**  It contains all the built-in controls. You can click to select the control you need, and drag it to **②area** to complete the creation of the control. The specific demonstration is as follows:
  
     ![Create control demo](assets/ide/create_control.gif)  
    
  4. **④ Area - Property**  When you select a control in  **area②** , all its properties will be displayed here in the form of a table, and you can customize and modify it in the table. For example, to modify the text size, the specific demonstration is as follows:

  5. **⑤ Area - Outline View** It displays all the created controls in the form of a tree diagram; also supports free expansion/collapse; can clearly understand the hierarchical relationship between the controls; and can be directly dragged and dropped A certain node can quickly adjust the position of the hierarchy; double-click the node to quickly show/hide the controls. This is very easy to use when the hierarchy is complicated. The specific demonstration is as follows:

  6. **⑥ Area - Console** When compiling the code, this location will output the compilation log. If the compilation fails, double-click **error prompt content**to jump directly to the corresponding code.  
 As shown in the figure below, it demonstrates that double-click the error message and jump directly to the code.

With the above foundation, now, we can officially start development.
